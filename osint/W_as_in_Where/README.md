## Description
Someone has died unexpectedly. 
The police is on it, but between you and me, I cannot wait for the police. 
I am a private investigator and I need your help. 
Unfortunately, we might be tracked so I cannot give you the information directly. 
Start in a major social network. 
Certainly not a problem for the best hacker I know right...?
Alright here goes a beautiful poem: 

```
Some people in weird ways were connected
Some were a triangle, some were less directed
For one night they all met
At doctor's Jonathan Abigdail the third they wept 
Things were said, threats in the air
A few days later someone is dead
Who is that someone? That is for you to find,
Also who is the killer, if you really don't mind.
```

_Note for the all the challenges:_
*The challenge is divided into three parts: Where, Weapon, and Who. 
In each one you can find the flag somwhere online. 
You might find the information in any order, however the expected order is: Where, Weapon and Who. 
Example: If the answer is knife then when you would discover that somewhere: like 
"the killer used a idek{knife_V5478G}" or instructions on how to get the flag: like "idek{weaponUsed_V5478G}}". The flag would then be idek{knife_V5478G}.*
